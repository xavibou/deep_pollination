Insect Image Classification for Monitoring of Pollinating Insects

This is a research project on Insect Image Classification for Monitoring of Pollinating Insects performed using data provided by the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (Paris, France) in collaboration with Université Paris Saclay. This project was performed along some classmates while attending my MSc in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence track at Paris Saclay.

The project consisted in the creation (and solution) of a CodaLab challenge for Image Classification of bees, wasps, butterflies, other insects and non-insect images. The source code is not provided since it could be used by challenge participants (which would be cheating! :) ).
